                        <p style="text-align: justify;"> " My journey is a tapestry woven with diverse experiences and educational milestones. From my foundation at Sekolah Kebangsaan Kampung Rambai for my upsr, Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Tanah Merah for PT3 and SPM, to earning my STPM certificate at Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Pendang, my commitment to learning is unwavering. Currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Information Science at Universiti Teknologi MARA, I am bridging the realms of academia and practical expertise. My experiences include being a dedicated Volunteer Member of the Malaysian Civil Defense Force, where I underwent rigorous training in first aid, firefighting, rescue operations, and handling dangerous creatures. Additionally, I've contributed my skills to Anika Restu Trading 2, excelling in coordinating food and beverage logistics for events. As an Assistant Land Surveyor, I actively participated in land measurement processes. My tenure as a Logistics Operations Specialist at MALAYSIA POST and a Sales Assistant at 7 Eleven further polished my adaptability and decision-making skills. Proficient in Microsoft Office, Photoshop, video editing, and ICT, I bring not just technical skills but a proven ability to work under pressure, adapt, and make informed decisions. Fluent in Malay, English, and Indonesian, I am ready to embrace new challenges and contribute my diverse skill set to meaningful projects. "
